I'm sure a mathematician would claim that 0 and 1 are both very
interesting numbers.  :-)

True, it returns "" for false, but "" is an even more interesting
number than 0.

I don't think I'm gonna agree with that.  Way too much visual confusion...

Of course, this being Perl, we could always take both approaches.  :-)

Soitainly.  I was assuming that came with the OO-ness of it.
